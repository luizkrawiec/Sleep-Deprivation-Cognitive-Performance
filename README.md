# Sleep-Deprivation-Cognitive-Performance
In this project, I undertake a comprehensive statistical analysis of a dataset sourced from Kaggle, aiming to extract meaningful insights and identify underlying patterns within the data.The analytical approach is structured as follows:

**Data Acquisition and Understanding:** The initial phase involves importing the dataset and conducting a thorough review of its structure. This includes examining the dimensions of the data, understanding the types of variables present, and assessing the completeness of the data by identifying any missing values.


**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: **EDA is performed to summarize the main characteristics of the data. This includes:**

**Descriptive Statistics:** Calculating measures such as mean, median, standard deviation, and range to understand the distribution of numerical variables.

**Data Visualization:** Creating visual representations like histograms, box plots, and scatter plots to identify trends, patterns, and potential outliers.

**Statistical Testing and Inference:** To validate hypotheses and draw conclusions, various statistical tests are applied, such as:

**Correlation Analysis:** Assessing the relationships between variables using Pearson or Spearman correlation coefficients.

**Comparative Tests:** Utilizing t-tests or non-parametric alternatives to compare groups within the data.

**Interpretation and Reporting:** The final step involves interpreting the results in the context of the original research questions, discussing the implications of the findings, and suggesting potential areas for further research.

This structured approach ensures a thorough and methodical analysis, facilitating the extraction of actionable insights from the dataset.
